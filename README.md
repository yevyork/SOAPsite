# SOAPsite

## The very first website I built from scratch! 
#### It includes two distinct pages, complete with images from the web- all related to the subject matter on the page.

### Before I get into the actual site, I think it's a good idea that as a beginner, I detail what elements of this project were "wins", and what parts I ran into "struggles" with.

## Wins!

1. The general syntax of HTML and CSS. I found this to be significantly more easier to grasp than the nightmare (presently) of dealing with javaScript syntax. Although HTML and CSS aren't classified as programming languages, they can still provide an enjoyable experience to the user if properly implemented.
2. I love that I finally understand Flexbox! I could say that I initially struggled with it, but thanks to @maddyrombes, w3schools.com, and my brain (in that particular order), I was able to finally understand the purpose of it and how powerful it is for organizing nearly any part of a well-designed webpage. @anpato also helped :)
3. CSS animations. When we went over this topic in class, I thought to myself "Wow, another struggle." I was wrong. They make a lot of sense and are an amazing feature. I look forward to using them again!

## Struggles

1. Properly organizing my HTML and CSS. At first I didn't understand why my page looked buggy and things didn't work how they were supposed to. It was a wee bit discouraging, but I powered through it and understood what goes where.
2. Event Handlers are a pain in the butt. I know they're extremely important but nevertheless, a pain in the butt.
3. Getting enough sleep during this experience. I am sleep-deprived. I'm even writing this at 1:30am. TGIF though.

## Inspiration
* I like sneakers and I use an app called GOAT to check prices on exclusive pairs of shoes sometimes. Their layout is simple yet appealing. I love the minimalistic approach and how everything is made up of rectangles. The contrastic colors between sections are what gives the site it's vibe. I figured I couldn't go wrong with using GOAT.com to model my first project. To be frank, I also thought it was going to be more-or-less a simpler task. I was wrong. 

### Let's have a look at my mock-up!

* The mobile versions look approximately the same- just wanted to avoid taking up extra space on this doc. As minimalistic as I wanted to be, I still ended up making this a very thorough mock-up. In fact, I really enjoyed using Adobe XD- highly recommend it to anyone who will be plotting out ideas for a website. 

* Update!: I made a gif of the site: [GIF](https://github.com/yevyork/SOAPsite/blob/master/SOAPsite20fps.gif)

* I had a lot of fun making this come to life. I was told that I would learn a lot in the process, and I did- not just about putting code together, but about myself as well.

* You probably want to see the actual site, right? <a href="https://yevyork.github.io/SOAPsite/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fine, Whatever.</a> It's not like this whole README is dedicated to it or anything.



#### Cheers,
#### Yev.
